For global variables, storing in static storing area.
Even though they are initialized in this file, they may
be modified before the execution of function in this file.
Thus, Compiler cannot compute them directly but view them
as unknown (volatile)when compiling this file and load from memory.
For local variables, storing in stack of function. They are
private data for this function and known when compiling this
file. Hence, compiler sum them up when compiling optimizing.
